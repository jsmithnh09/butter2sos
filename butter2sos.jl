Z-domain IIR Butterworth design of Lowpass/Highpass/Allpass filters.
`Fc` indicates the corner "-3 dB" natural frequency point, whereas `Fs` indicates
the discrete sample rate and `order` specifies the cascade filter order. The returned
`sos` matrix contains the raw second-order section coefficients that can be used to
construct a `SecondOrderSection` type.
